# AI-Engine
Voice Assistant - created using Google and Wolfram Alpha APIs

//This was created when I was 15 years old (in 2011). Putting on GitHub for others to have a look at.

//Disclaimer: excuse the horrible code.

##The Aim
To keep increasing its possibilities until it can eventually interpret speech, execute a command, and return an answer to a question by speech.

##How?
The AI Engine is programmed using XHTML/HTML5, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. It uses a whole load of APIs, combined with proprietary code, to attempt to answer any question you have for it.

##Using the Engine
It's as simple as thinking of a question, clicking the mic icon (located to the right), and asking the question. The engine is best at answering fact based questions right now (e.g.- How tall in the Empire State Building?), but there is no harm in asking it anything (e.g.- How are you?).

Update (2016): Unfortunately some of the web browser features, which this program replied on to operate have since been removed by the web browsers (such as Google Chrome, and Firefox).
